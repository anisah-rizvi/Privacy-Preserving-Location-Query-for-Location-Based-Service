# Privacy-Preserving-Location-Query-for-Location-Based-Service
Location-based services (LBS) like Google Maps, Swiggy, Zomato, Ola, and Uber have become essential in contemporary digital existence, providing users with tailored navigation, transportation, and service suggestions through the constant transmission of real-time GPS coordinates to distant servers. This guarantees convenience and precision; however, it also presents considerable privacy issues, as each location inquiry can disclose sensitive information such as residential and occupational addresses, travel patterns, medical appointments, and personal inclinations, facilitating the development of intricate behavioral profiles that may be misused for surveillance or unauthorized access. This study addresses the conflict between utility and privacy by developing a privacy-preserving model for location-based searches, enabling users to receive recommendations for nearby services (e.g., hospitals or ATMs) without disclosing their precise location. The suggested method utilizes privacy- enhancing approaches in lieu of raw GPS data, ensuring accuracy and anonymity while balancing utility and confidentiality to foster secure, responsible, and privacy- conscious digital interactions.
